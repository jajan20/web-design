## Usercase
#### Users
Bob is a huge fan of manga, but for a while now he hasn’t found any that suits his taste. Now he’s looking for a website where he can get some help finding a new manga.

- Casually browse through the availble collection.
- Being able to save which chapter the user last read.
- Do specific search queries.
- Being able to sort
- Being able to filter
- Leave a rating on the manga(chapter?) you’ve read.
