Back then, she was a quiet girl who had a quirky oddness to her. When he runs into her out of coincidence two years later, however, he finds that she's become an out-going (if not slightly high-strung) girl. A few weeks after their chance meeting, he receives a phone call from the hospital saying she had tried to kill herself, and he finds out the true reason for the drastic change.\r\n\r\n• Fight!\r\nYuki's a hard-working 21 year old who's tirelessly slugging away as a coordinator at a English language school so that she can save enough money to go study abroad. She has no interest in guys because she's so set on her goal---that is, until she meets Yuki, a guy with the same name as her. They move in together only days after they met, and at first things go well, but one day, he hits her in the face by accident. The violence escalates as the days wear on --- will their love last?!\r\n\r\n• The Days of the Sun\r\nNana and Ichi are twins who are as close as can be. Sure the people around them think it's odd that they still sleep in the same bed --- but they couldn't care less what others think. All they need is each other. One day, they run into a scruffy looking man wearing dark sunglasses who claims that he's their long-lost dad! Is it really him? And why did he choose to reveal himself to them now?\r\n\r\nIncludes other stories which all center around the theme: \"a rose-colored tomorrow.\" ",
